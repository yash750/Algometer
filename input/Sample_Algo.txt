 Title: Check if a Number is Prime

1. Start: Begin the process.
2. Take Input: Get the number to be checked.
3. Handle Simple Cases: If the number is less than or equal to 1, it’s not prime.
4. Process Each Divisor: For numbers greater than 1, check divisibility by every integer starting from 1.
5. Check Divisibility: If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it’s not prime.
6. Return Result: If no divisors were found, the number is prime.
7. End: The process is complete.
